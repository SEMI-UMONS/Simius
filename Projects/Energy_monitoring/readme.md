###Use a Grove current measure Module and Simius card (PIC16F887 or PIC18F4550)##

This project is based on the Grove current measure module. An interface has been created to place the measurement in the positive part of the signal (see in the documents). The measurement is performed by the ADC of the microcontroller, because the output of the current measurement interface is analog.
