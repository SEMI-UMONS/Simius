# SEMi — Electronics & Microélectronics #

 Electronics & Microelectronics Unit at the University of Mons [UMONS] Belgium

----------
On this site, we try to provide as many examples and documentation as possible so that each student who wishes to carry out a personal project or for the community, has everything in hand to be able to start in good conditions, because some examples have already been performed to test sensors or peripherals. 
`Of course the codes aren't always optimized, but they are there just for testing or examples.`

## Repository Contents ##
* /examples —  Example sketch for PIC 16F887 or 18F4550.
* /Projet — Various basic project or student project.
* /Documents —  All documentation related to examples or projects.

## Documentations ##
* Documentation for Modules and interfaces.
* Components Datasheet.
* Basic example codes for sensors or peripherals.


## Microcontroller and compiler ##
* Microcontroler Microchip PIC 16F887 and 18F4550.
* C compiler - [CCS C Compiler](http://www.ccsinfo.com "CCS C Compiler")
